# Learn-ReactJS
A repository to store and track all resources used while learning ReactJS

## Prerequisites

In order to run a local ReactJS environment, you need to have access to `npm`.

```
npm --version
```

If running this command, returns `npm: command not found`, you need to install **`node`**

### Installing

Although you can install Node in other ways, we recommend using Homebrew.

Make sure Hombrew is up to date:

```
brew update
```

Install **Node**

```
brew install node
```
